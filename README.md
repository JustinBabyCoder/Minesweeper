This is a README file for a Minesweeper project implemented in Python. The project consists of three files: minesweeper.py, game.py, and main.py.

File 1: minesweeper.py
This file contains the implementation of the Minesweeper class. The class represents the Minesweeper game and includes methods for initializing the game, setting mines, defining a cell, opening cells, and drawing the field.

File 2: game.py
This file contains the implementation of the Game class. The class represents the game itself and includes methods for initializing the game, handling user input, updating the game state, and drawing the game field.

File 3: main.py
This file serves as the entry point for running the Minesweeper game. It imports the Game class from game.py, instantiates the class, and calls the play() method to start the game.

How to Run the Game
To run the Minesweeper game, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
Download or clone the repository containing the project files.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project files are located.
Run the following command to start the game: python main.py

Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the field size and difficulty level.
Once the game starts, use the arrow keys to move the marker and press the spacebar to dig. The goal of the game is to uncover all the cells without hitting a mine.
Enjoy playing Minesweeper!
Note: The game is currently a work in progress. Some features, such as flag placement, are not yet implemented.
