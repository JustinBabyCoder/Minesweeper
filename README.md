# Minesweeper
# ENG
This is a simple, console-based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. It is achieved using Python. The game consists of 3 files:

**Minesweeper.py (File 1)**: This file is responsible for creating the Minesweeper field, placing mines and assigning numbers to the cells. Here's what it does:

- Sets up a grid of specified size, with a range limit of 10 to 20.
- Places mines on the grid, the number of which is based on the size of the grid as well as the difficulty level.
- Assigns numbers to each non-mine cell, representing how many neighboring cells contain mines.

**game.py (File 2)**: This file is where the main gameplay occurs. It contains class Game with several methods for different game operations like digging (uncovering a cell), putting flags, validating the win or lose conditions, and displaying the game grid.

- Retrieves the user's preferred field size and difficulty level for the game.
- Dynamically assigns flags corresponding to the number of mines.
- Monitors user input for navigating through the game grid, placing flags or uncovering cells.

**main.py (File 3)**: This is the initiation file. Here, an instance of the Game class from game.py is created and the `play()` method is called to start the game. It is the entrypoint for the entire game.

The visual representation of the game grid, playerâ€™s progress, and end game notifications are all managed and provided in the console.

## Setup Instructions:
To set up the game, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_link>`
- Navigate to the directory containing the files: `cd Minesweeper`
- Run the entrypoint script: `python main.py`

Have fun playing Minesweeper from your console!
